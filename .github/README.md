[Original NewPipe Readme](../README.md)
## About this fork
This fork is only for use on Android Kitkat aka 4.4 aka SDK 19.

The codebase is based on (Brave)NewPipe v0.23.3 as this was the last
version to support Android KitKat. I will only try to maintain the
functionality.

No features will be developed or backported by myself. If someone wants a
feature included, a PR can be created and if suitable I will add it.

## Which additional platforms are supported?
Same as [BraveNewPipe](../../../../NewPipe)

## Reporting bugs
Most problems with BraveNewPipe should be reported to the NewPipeExtractor
project, as platform support is developed there.
